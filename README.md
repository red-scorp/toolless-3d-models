# toolless-3d-models

Toolless 3D Models created with OpenSCAD.
Main goal is a total independence from 3rd party supply chains and only reliance on your own 3D Printer!
This project includes 3D models which require no tools and extra components to construct.
No visits to Home Depot, Bauhaus and other home improvement supplies shops required!
